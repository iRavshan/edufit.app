# Edufit - Keep Your Brain Fit

## Introduction

Edufit is a project targeted to improve the knowledge of school-children pupils. This is also a solution to analyse their acquiring using clear data and find out critically which pupils have trouble learning which lessons. The platform is completely free of charge to use for everyone. You can take your grade-based tests or read the free lessons on the platform. If you do not know which ones are more efficient for you, do not worry about that! We recommend lessons and competitions on your home page ourselves according to your last test results and search history. 

## Built-in with

`python 3.10` * `Django 5.0` * `PostgreSQL` * `Redis`
